## About releases and associated branches
Each normative release has its own branch within this repository.
For related specification documents and resources follow the link to 'Release documents' above.'

The status of a release branch can either be 'in progress', 'pre-released' or 'released'. The content is subject to changes in state 'in progress' and 'pre-released'. In 'released' state only minor and non-normative changes like editorial corrections, adding examples or additional information may apply.

Normative changes to a released version will be covered by a follow-up version in a separate branch (see 'Follow-up' above). The ancestor of the current release is 'Previous release'.
